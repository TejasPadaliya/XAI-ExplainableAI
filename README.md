# Explainable AI (XAI) Projects

This repository is a growing collection of projects demonstrating various Explainable AI (XAI) techniques for machine learning interpretability and transparency.

## Overview

Explainable AI bridges the gap between complex ML models and human understanding. Each project here focuses on a specific XAI method such as LIME, SHAP, and more.

## Included Projects

| Project | Description | XAI Method | Link |
|----------|--------------|------------|------|
| **Loan Approval Prediction** | Predicts whether a loan will be approved or rejected using a Random Forest model. Explains each decision using **LIME**, showing which features (e.g., Income, Credit History, Education) influenced the result. | LIME | [View Project →](LoanApproval/reports/report.md)
| **Credit Purpose Classification** | Classifies the purpose of a credit request (e.g., car, radio/TV, furniture) using a Random Forest model. Provides **LIME-based local explanations** showing which applicant features (like age, job type, savings, credit amount) pushed the model toward or away from a specific credit purpose. | LIME | [View Project →](CreditApproval/reports/report.md) |
